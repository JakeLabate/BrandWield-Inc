Can do:
- Save browser image uploads for image files to public 'google cloud storage' links (and then to save to firebase as the image variables)
- Create templates in Bannerbear for social media banners
- 'clear' buttons
        - stops working from 'brand' section down
        - does not work with images & fonts
Varibles to add:
- 'team description' (describe your team in 1 sentence)
- 'person1Bio' + others (describe your team member in 1 sentence)

Solve:
- Figure out how to 'write' or 'set' data to firebase upon the 'lock' button being pressed.
- Show where variable is changed in the users brand content from the 'myBrand' page (where they edit the variables)
- Add a 'click-to-add' function to addable 'myBrand' variables like 'people', 'offerings', 'locations', 'testimonials' etc.
- Firebase hosting to live url
        - Set up user accounts with firebase auth and allow account-specific functions
- Import instagram api profile url pic to the image placeholder
